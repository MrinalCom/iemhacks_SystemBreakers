PROBLEM STATEMENT:-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imagine a scenario where a person living in a remote rural area is facing health issues. Accessing specialized medical care is a challenge due to the distance from urban centers. They are unsure about their symptoms and lack transportation options to visit a hospital. Moreover, local medical facilities have limited resources and might not offer the required tests or treatments.
Here, the Carewave application can provide a solution. The person can use the app to schedule a video call appointment with a qualified healthcare professional. They can describe their symptoms through AI-driven chat, receiving preliminary information about their condition. The app can also help them locate nearby hospitals, clinics, and test centers, suggesting the most suitable options for their needs. In case of urgent medication requirements, the app can facilitate the delivery of emergency medicines to their location. This comprehensive solution ensures that individuals in remote areas can access timely medical advice, relevant facilities, and essential medicines, overcoming the barriers posed by distance and limited local resources
